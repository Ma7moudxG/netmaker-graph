Graph Project - README
------------------------

Overview
--------
This project is a dynamic graph visualization application that fetches nodes and edges from an API, displays them interactively in a graph structure, and allows users to search for nodes and navigate between them using keyboard shortcuts. It utilizes React for building the user interface and Next.js for server-side rendering and routing. The graph is rendered using the XYFlow library to manage the graph structure and interactions.

Technologies Used
-----------------
React: For building the user interface and managing application state.
Next.js: For server-side rendering, routing, and React integration.
XYFlow: A library for rendering and managing graph structures in the frontend.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the application with utility-first CSS.
TypeScript: For adding type safety to the JavaScript code.
Node.js: Backend environment for running the development server.
Vercel: Deployment platform (optional, if deploying the project online).
Prerequisites
Before running the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or above) - For running JavaScript outside of the browser.
npm (Node Package Manager) - For managing project dependencies.
Git - For version control (optional, but recommended).
You can download and install Node.js from here.

Setting Up the Project Locally
-------------------------------
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graph-project.git
cd graph-project
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using npm.

bash
Copy code
npm install
This will install all the necessary dependencies defined in the package.json file.

3. Configure the Environment
If you need any environment variables (e.g., API keys, custom settings), create a .env.local file at the root of the project and add your configurations there. For example:

arduino
Copy code
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
This step might not be necessary if the project does not require any environment variables.

4. Running the Development Server
After installing the dependencies, you can run the development server locally:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the Next.js development server and you can access the project in your browser at:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
The server will automatically reload any changes you make to the code.

5. Building for Production (Optional)
To create a production build of the application, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will build the app for production. After building, you can run the production server locally:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will serve the optimized build at http://localhost:3000.

Key Features
------------
Dynamic Graph Rendering: The graph is rendered using the XYFlow library, with nodes and edges that are fetched from an API.
Responsive Layout: The graph layout adapts to different screen sizes, with smaller screens showing a more compact graph.
Node Search: Users can search for nodes by name, and the graph will filter nodes and edges based on the query.
Keyboard Navigation: Users can navigate between nodes using keyboard shortcuts.


Project Structure
-----------------
The project is organized as follows:

bash
Copy code
/graph-project
├── /components           # Contains React components like Graph, SearchBar, etc.

├── /pages                # Contains Next.js pages (main entry point for the app)

├── /public               # Static assets (images, icons, etc.)

├── /styles               # Tailwind CSS styles

├── /types                # TypeScript types

├── /utils                # Utility functions (e.g., for API calls)

├── package.json          # Project configuration and dependencies

├── tailwind.config.js    # Tailwind CSS configuration

└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration

Notable Files:
--------------
/pages/index.tsx: The main entry point of the app, where the graph is rendered.
/components/Graph.tsx: The component responsible for rendering the graph structure using XYFlow.
/components/SearchBar.tsx: A search bar to filter nodes by their labels.
/components/GraphKeyboardNavigator.tsx: A component that enables keyboard navigation between nodes in the graph.
/styles/globals.css: Global styles, including Tailwind CSS setup.
